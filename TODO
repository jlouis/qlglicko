* DONE Dialyzer warnings!
* DONE Overload Protection
* DONE Part of the tournament code has been written
* DONE Introduce dispcount as a tool.
* DONE When ranking tournaments, do not make processes that dies.
* DONE Tournament code misses pushbacks to the DB when ranking is done.
* DONE Fix the query for tournament players
  We should query for a player and always fetch his rating
  It fails because the second UNION is the one providing the solution,
  then we get the wrong result.
* DONE Make ranking single-threaded
  A single-threaded ranker is easier and what we need for this.
* DONE Make ranking setup-based
  Rather than run the ranking from a database query all the time, we
  can as well pre-setup the most common queries so we can run them
  again and again in the system. This will allow us to run parallel
  annealed ranking faster by looking up data in the system directory.
* DONE Figure out why the ranker produces outright INSANE results
  I've seen users with rankings so high it can't be right at all. We
  need to figure out why that is the case. I suggest we build a system
  which can output ranking runs so we can take a look if it looks
  right or not.
** DONE Enable CSV output of players
*** DONE Make the ranking loader able to load players as well.
    We should be able to load player names
*** DONE When outputting rankings, use the real player names
** DONE Investigate the player rankings via R.
   I have a hunch something is kinda wrong and we need to find it.

   There isn't anything wrong. The problem is that Bashma4ek plays
   Lp_Na1l as a new player. Lp_Na1l is new, so he has this insanely
   high initial RD. Hence he gets 2400 Rating points. Now, since
   Bashma4ek plays him like 50 times, his initial rating will be
   insanely high. That is the problem.
*** DONE There is a player with an insane rating. why?
    The player is named Bashma4ek

* DONE Write prediction code.
  The prediction code is rather simple really. For each match, look up
  the player rankings. Assume the best player wins. Count wins. Count
  total matches. Prediction rate follows.
* TODO Find a way to control that the rankings are insane
  We probably need a way to limit the initial ranking based upon the
  number of games the player plays. Just setting it at 350 seems to be
  way a too high initial RD if this can happen. We need to look to the
  web for suggestions on how to limit this down.
* TODO Allow the ranker to run with different configuration parameters
  This generalization is needed in order to make simulated annealing
  runs
* TODO Link prediction code into the simulated annealer.
* TODO Obtain good values
