List of things for the next release:

· Production on blue.

· Deploying to green:
· DONE: Get Snapphanen in as the last player in the matchup.
· Update the qlglicko.dump database, readying up for the next round of tunings.
· Update the annealer to make it faster
  · Speed up calculation of duel rounds.
  · Anneal again, this time with per-player rankings.
· Update the matrix ranker for the top players.

· Properly handle banned players
	If the player turns out to be banned, the Id of that player is not valid.
	We mark that player by moving him to to banned-list.
	
	Add another field to the duel_match called "valid" and then proceed by
	making this false for every game played by a banned player.
	
	Alternatively, do not pick matches where the player is in the banned list.
	
	Banned players are otherwise treated like unknown players.
