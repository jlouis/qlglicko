* When storing raw matches, save when we pulled them.
  We are only going to run a tournament if all matches are
  solved. And all players are solved.

  Players are solved when all players have been pulled after the end
  tournament date. This gives a switch TIMESTAMP after which we know all
  relevant matches are in queue.

  We stamp each match with a provisional timestamp of when they have been added to the DB.
  When all matches less than the above switch TIMESTAMP has been fetched, we are ready to rank.

* Dialyzer warnings!
* Consider using a specific HTTP profile
* Tournament code is not yet written.

* Code could do with some testing.
