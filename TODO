List of things for the next release:

· Deploying to blue.
· Update the supervisor tree with the new supervisor structure.
· Get the database updated so it contains map information about players as well.
· Properly handle players who are unknown.
	Add a new update list for these kinds of things to the player map
	When checking a player, also check this update-list. If too old, then check
	  the player. Approximately do this once a month.
	Unknown players are moved to the hall-of-fame list.
· Properly handle banned players
	If the player turns out to be banned, the Id of that player is not valid.
	We mark that player by moving him to to banned-list.
	
	Add another field to the duel_match called "valid" and then proceed by
	making this false for every game played by a banned player.
	
	Alternatively, do not pick matches where the player is in the banned list.
	
	Banned players are otherwise treated like unknown players.
