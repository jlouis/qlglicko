· Production on green.

Deploying to blue:
· Correctly update safetyvalve to the newest version.

SWITCH Deploy

· Update the qlglicko.dump database, readying up for the next round of tunings.
· fprof the ranking code
	To figure out why things take so much time to run, do an fprof run on rounds 1..10
	  so we know what is taking all the time in there. This will hint us toward what kind of
	  optimization we should go for and what is currently happening in the code w.r.t
	  time usage.
· Update the annealer to make it faster
  · Speed up calculation of duel rounds.
  · Anneal again, this time with per-player rankings.

· Properly handle banned players
	If the player turns out to be banned, the Id of that player is not valid.
	We mark that player by moving him to to banned-list.
	
	Add another field to the duel_match called "valid" and then proceed by
	making this false for every game played by a banned player.
	
	Alternatively, do not pick matches where the player is in the banned list.
	
	Banned players are otherwise treated like unknown players.
